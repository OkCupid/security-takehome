### The below is intended to test your comfort level with scripting and experience with different technologies, such as AWS, Terraform, Bash and/or Python. Please answer what you can to the best of your ability. If you are unfamiliar with something, skip it. 
### When you complete this tasks, create .txt or a .MD file called `results` with the output of the questions you completed (be sure to annotate the question number), make a directory named `submission_<your initials>` and copy all the code you wrote, the `results` file, and all related and necesary files to the directory - *Please include the answers to the questions above as well.

### Completion of the GPG section is mandatory üëá üîê
### You will then encrypt the directory with our public gpg key and upload it to your fork and open a PR. (Our key is uploaded to `keys.openpgp.org` with the   email `security@okcupid.com`. If you are unfamiliar with this process, please use this site as reference `https://yanhan.github.io/posts/2017-09-27-how-to-use-gpg-to-encrypt-stuff/`)


1. Suppose that you have an s3 bucket, `bucket`, which contains a file, `wordlist` that contains a comma-separated list of words. Write a lambda function which will  receive a json event payload containing a query string. The Lambda function should check whether the query word is in the wordlist and place the result on an SQS queue as well as return it.

   Sample wordlist:

   ``` 
   working,for,okcupid,is,really,fun,come,join,us
   ```

   Sample request:

   ``` json
   {
     "query":"for"
   }
   ```
2. Write Terraform code to deploy the above.
3. Using the [Harry Potter API](https://hp-api.herokuapp.com/), retrieve a list of students and their houses, print a list sorted by house then alphabetical order.
4. Write a bash script to find every file owned by a user `ex: joe` and output the number of lines in the file.
5. Create a file named `permissions.txt` and grant **all** permissions to the owner of the file, **read and execute** permissions for the group, and **execute** permissions for all other users. Take a screenshot of the file and the permissions after you are done.
